# Windows 10 openHAB App

<!-- https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/de/#downloadOnAppstore -->

We provide a native Windows 10 app for openHAB, compatible with Windows laptops, desktops, tablets and phones (Xbox, Raspberry Pi and Holographic coming soon).
It uses the REST API of openHAB to render sitemaps of your openHAB installation.
The latest release version of the app is always available through the Windows Store.
